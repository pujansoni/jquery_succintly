<!-- Using the handy live() event method, you can bind handlers to DOM elements currently in a web page and those that have yet to be added. The live() method uses event delegation to make sure that newly added/created DOM elements will always respond to event handlers regardless of DOM manipulations or dynamic changes to the DOM. Using live() is essentially a shortcut for manually having to set up event delegation. -->

<!-- After examining the code, it should be obvious that we are using live() to apply event delegation to a parent element so that any button element added to the DOM always responds to the click handler.
To remove the live element, we simply use the die() method. eg: $('button').die() -->
