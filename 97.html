<!-- Three concepts need to called out when using the fadeIn(), fadeOut() and fadeTo() methods.
Unlike other effect methods, fading methods only adjust the opacity of an element. It is assumed when using these effect methods that any element being faded already has a height and width.
Fading animations will fade elements from their current opacity.
Using the fadeOut() method will fade an element form its current opacity and then once 100% faded, it will change the CSS display property of the element to 'none' -->
