<!-- Event delegation relies on event propagation. When you click an <a> inside of a <li>, which is inside of a <ul>, the click event bubbles up the DOM from the <a> to the <li> to the <ul> and so on until each ancestor element with a function assigned to an event handler fires. This means if we attach a click event to a <ul> and then click an <a> that is encapsulated inside of the <ul>, eventually the click handler attached to the <ul>, because of bubbling will be invoked. When it is invoked, we can use the event object (event.target) to identify which element in the DOM actually caused the event bubbling to begin. Again this will give us a reference to the element that started the bubbling. -->

<!-- Now if you were to literally click on one of the acutal bullets of the list and not the link itself guess what? You will end up removing the <ul>. Because all clicks bubble. So when you click on the bullet the event.target is the <li> and not the <a>. Since this is the case the parent() method will grab the <ul> and remove it. We could update our code so that we only remove an <li> when it is being clicked form an <a> by passing the parent() method an element expression.
$(event.target).parent('li').remove();
