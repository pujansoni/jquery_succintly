<!-- Most javascript nowadays, especially jQuery code, will involve manipulating the DOM. This means the DOM has to be fully parsed by the browser in order for you to operate on it. This fact is why developers has been stuck on the window.onload roller coaster ride for a couple of years now.
To avoid using the ready() event for code that operates on the DOM, you can simply place your code in an HTML document before the closing </body> element. Doing so ensures the DOM is completely loaded, simply because the browser will parse the document from top to bottom. If you place your JavaScript code in the document after the DOM elements it manipulates, there is no need to use the ready() event. -->
