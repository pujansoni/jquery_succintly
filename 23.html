<!-- It is often necessary to determine if the selected set of element does, in fact, contain a specific element. Using the is() method, we can check the current set against an expression/filter. The check will return true if the set contains at least one element that is selected by the given expression/filter. If it does not contain the element, a false value is returned. -->

<!-- The is() method is quite handy for determining if the wrapper set contains a specific element. Some developers use is('.class') to determine if an element has a specific class. Do not forget that jQuery already has a method for doing this called hasClass('class'), which can be used on elements that contain more than one class value. But truth be told, hasClass() is just a convenient wrapper for the is() method. -->
