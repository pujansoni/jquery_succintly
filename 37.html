<!-- The find() method, on the other hand can be used to further find descendants of the currently selected elements. Think of find() more like updating or changing the current wrapped set with new elements that are encapsulated within the elements that are already selected. The code below will change the wrapped set from <p> elements to two <strong> elements by using find() -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	<p><strong>first</strong></p>
	<p>middle</p>
	<p><strong>last</strong></p>
	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js">
	</script>
	<script> (function($){
			//Alerts strong
			alert($('p').find('strong').get(0).nodeName);
			alert($('p').find('strong').andSelf());
		})(jQuery);
	</script>
</body>
</html>
<!-- The concept to take away is that filter() will only reduce the currently selected elements in the wrapper set while find() can actually create an entirely new set of wrapped elements. Note: Both find() and filter() are destructive methods that can be undone by using end(), which will revert the wrapped set back to its previous state before find() or filter() were used. -->
