<!-- Using the animate() method you can set animations to occur non-sequentially or at the same time by passing all the CSS property changes to a single animate() method call. In the code below the <div> will animate its width and border left width at the same time -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	<div style="height: 100px; width: 100px; background-color: red;"></div>
	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js">
	</script>
	<script> (function($){
			// Both width and borderLeftWidth properties will animate simultaneously
			$('div').animate({width: '200px', borderLeftWidth: '10px'}, 1000);
		})(jQuery);
	</script>
</body>
</html>
<!-- 
Animate() is the base low-level abstraction:
The animate() method is the base method that is used to construct all the pre-configured animations eg: hide(), slideDown(). It provides the ability to change the values of style properties.
Here is what you need to know when using this method:
i) Only properties that take numeric values are supported. In other words, you can't animate the value of say, the backgroundColor property(At least not without a plugin). Also, properties that take more than one value like backgroundPosition can not be animated.
ii) You can animate CSS properties by using em and % where applicable.
iii) Relative animations can be specified using '+=' or '-=' in front of the property value. This would for example, move an element positively or negatively to its current position.
iv) If you specify an animation duration of 0, the animation will immediately set the elements to their end state.
v) As a shortcut, if a value of toggle is passed, an animation will simply reverse from where it is and animate to that end.
vi) All CSS properties set via a single animate() method will animate at the same time.
